Requires rust nightly.
The mold linker is also required to build on Linux.

Setup for Arch systems:
```bash
# install git
pacman -S git
# install mold linker
pacman -S mold clang
# install rustup for rust versioning
pacman -S rustup
# use rustup to install rust nightly
rustup install nightly
```

Setup for debian systems:
```bash
# install git
apt-get install git
# install mold linker
apt-get install mold clang
# install rustup for rust versioning
apt-get install rustup
# use rustup to install rust nightly
rustup install nightly
```
For install information for other platforms, see the Bevy setup guide: https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup/#installing-rust

After system packages have been installed, clone and build the repository:
```bash
# open the location where the repository should go in a terminal
# then clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TheFinchMachine/asteroids_bevy.git
# move into the repository folder
cd asteroids-bevy
# build in debug mode
cargo build
```
